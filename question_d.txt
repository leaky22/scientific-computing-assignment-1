Assignment 1 - Part (d)
Q (d) Differences Between Compiled and Interpreted Programming Languages

1. Compiled Languages:
- The entire program is translated into machine code before execution.
- Faster execution time since the code is already compiled.
- Examples: C, C++, Go.

2. Interpreted Languages:
- Code is executed line-by-line at runtime using an interpreter.
- Easier to debug and test code interactively.
- Examples: Python, JavaScript, Ruby.

3. Classification of Python:
- Python is an interpreted language.
- It uses an interpreter (like CPython) to execute code line-by-line at runtime, which makes it easier to test and debug.
